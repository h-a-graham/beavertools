# beavertools


A package that documents a selection of tools to help monitor the expansion of beaver populations.

This is a checklist of the functios that will be included:

- [x] Kernel Density Estimation of field Signs

- [x] Standardised mapping functions for foraging kernel density 

- [x] Automated territory detection

- [x] User modification of territory classes

- [x] Standardised mapping functions for territory locations/classes 

- [x] Animation function to animate a list of equally sized/scaled maps

- [ ] Population carrying capacity estimate.

- [ ] Standardised pop. capacity mapping functions

- [ ] DOCUMENT ALL FUNCTIONS AND DATASETS!


This example shows the kernel density estimate for feeding signs and the derived (automated) territory locations and their classification

This examples shows a developmental modelling approach to estimating the carrying capacity of beaver populations withing a catchment.
