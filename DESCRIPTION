Description: The selection of tools presented in this package provide: i) a range of analytical tools to quantify and map the distribution of beavers across a given catchment; ii) Functions to estimate the number of territories that exist in a catchment based off field-sign surveys; iii) Experimental functions to generate spatially explicit predictions of the maximum number of beaver territories that can be supported within a given catchment based on available resources and the available space.
